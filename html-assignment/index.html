        </article>
        <p>Hi my name is Rurangwa Loick, i am from Rwanda and i am 21 years old and this is my 2<sup>nd</sup> year in Canada where i take <abbr title="Interactive Media Design">IMD</abbr> at Algonquin College.Few things about me is that i like to socialise and make new friends<br> as i like getting to know new people and in my free time i like to play either video games or do some sports like football or basketball.</p>
        <p>One of the reasons why i chose this program is because as a kid i was always attracted to social media and the creative part of this world<br>and as i like video games i thought that this was the best program i would go for as it is helping me get more knowledge and meeting people with the same interest as me.</p>
